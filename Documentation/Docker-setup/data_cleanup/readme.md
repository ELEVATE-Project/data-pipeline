# Postgres Data Cleanup Script for Elevate Data Service

## üìå Purpose

This script is used to clean up the `elevate_data` PostgreSQL database. It performs the following actions:

- **Deletes** all tables **not** prefixed with `prod_`
- **Truncates** the following production tables:
    - `prod_solutions`
    - `prod_projects`
    - `prod_tasks`
    - `prod_dashboard_metadata`

This helps ensure only required production data is retained, while unnecessary tables and data are removed.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before executing the script, make sure you have:

- PostgreSQL **host/IP address**
- PostgreSQL **port**
- PostgreSQL **user credentials**

- Sufficient privileges to drop and truncate tables
